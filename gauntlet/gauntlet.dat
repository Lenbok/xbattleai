Around Orizan, a border city of the North march, rumors of raids
from the Wasted Land have grown bigger and bigger during the last
couple of months. And now from the forest north of the city,
horrified farmers report a quite impressive Barbarian army marching
toward Orizan. The imperial army prepares to face this new raid.

The raid on Orizan has been defeated, but the Barbarians are
surprisingly well organized and numerous. This raid was probably
the first wave of a bigger invasion scheme. A large army is
rushing into the North march, the Imperial 13th elite Corp has
been sent to stop the barbarians. The battle will take place on
the wide plain of Larmiz, which is quite densely populated.

The barbarian troops have surrounded and overcome Orizan. Motivated
by this victory, barbarians are now marching toward the stronghold
of Epinem, which is protecting the main access to the empire's capital.
The imperial stronghold is well prepared and is hosting a large army.
However, a defeat shall be fatal to the realm...

After the Larmiz plain victory, imperial scouts have spotted a
large barbarian camp, right on the border of the North March.
Usually, tribes don't gather in such a big and well organized
army. This is a very serious matter for the Emperor. To
definitively stop this invasion attempt, imperial commanders have
decided to attack and destroy the barbarian camp, which is protected
by a row of high hills

Reports from the expedition against the barbarian camp are pretty bad.
Evidences of a very unusual coalition between various barbarian tribes
have been found and barbarians are motivated with a surnatural fury.
Several flags and painted shields are decorated with a Red Gauntlet
symbol, which is unknown to the Emperor's wisest advisors. This could
be the symbol of a new leader, if he or she could succeed to gather all
the tribes together, this would be a great threat to the Empire.

The massive imperial army has been ordered to march toward the north.
As soldiers are gathering in the North March, on the other side of the
frontier, numerous barbarian tribes are gathering as well, preparing
for war. But before fortifications and camps are fully settled,
imperial scouts report sudden offensive moves. Barbarians are attacking
a incomplete imperial defensive line.

-Use reserve command to hold a perimeter (aim tgt cell+press 1-10)

The Imperial 13th elite Corp has failed to stop the barbarian army. A
quite large barbarian horde is now controlling part of the Larmiz
plain. The emperor himself has ordered an assault against the horde,
none of the invaders shall survive.
A mighty army, coming from the empire's capital, is now ready to
execute the emperor's will and exterminate invading barbarians.

The defensive line was too weak to hold barbarian assault. Several
small desorganised bands have successfully penetrated into the Larmiz
plain. A quite large imperial division has been sent to stop them. As
the reaction had to be very quick, imperial commander is not
particularly familiar with the map and he is discovering the land
around the city of Jakmil while barbarians are taking control of the
land.

The assault against the defensive line has been defeated. An imperial
detachment has decided to chase barbarians quite far away in the north.
They are exploring uncontrolled territory, where barbarian camps may be
anywhere. Scouts are reporting much stronger forces than expected, and
the imperial troops have to fight in an unknown territory, with little
hope of success. They will hold as long as they can.

The barbarian army is now settled in the Larmiz plain. Camps and raw
fortifications have been built. To take back control of the Larmiz
plain, Imperial troops must destroy the main barbarian camp in the
center of the land. Massive forces are sent to fulfill this task and
the barbarian camp is soon surrounded.
This is the final assault against the fortified place.

Both armies are now prepared, on each side of the empire's border,
countless troops are ready for the battle coming. The well ordered
Imperial army is facing a huge, blood thirsty, barbarian horde. The
battle will take place in a vast plain, between the two fortified
camps. Victory is the only mean to prevent the horde from devastating
the empire.
On a cold but sunny morning, the assault begins...
