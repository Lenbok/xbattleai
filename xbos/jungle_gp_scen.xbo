#@ Malaria Madness / guns & paratroopers
#@
#@ You wake up alone in a dangerous jungle. To survive you need to find towns.
#@ But although you know the general terrain, you do not know where the
#@ towns are, and because of the unpenetrable vegetation you can only
#@ see what is right next to you. Movement is also very slow, especially in
#@ the darkest parts of the wood.
#@ And in the far end of the jungle your enemy is already hiering an army.
#@
#@ This version includes guns and paratroopers
